# Prisoner's Dilemma Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the Prisoner's Dilemma in game theory, focusing on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) and recent tournament results. It aims to:

1. Explain the Prisoner's Dilemma and its iterated version
2. Analyze results from the most recent IPD tournament
3. Provide original analysis of available data from the latest IPD tournament

## Background
- The Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic game theory problem formulated in 1950
- It involves two players deciding to cooperate or defect, with various outcomes
- The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) involves repeated plays of the game

## Key Findings
- Recent tournaments have shown that Tit for Tat is no longer the top strategy
- More complex strategies using reinforcement learning, finite state automata, and hidden Markov models have proven successful
- The project uses the Axelrod-Python library for simulations and strategy comparisons

## Tools Used
- Axelrod-Python: An open-source library for simulating IPD tournaments
